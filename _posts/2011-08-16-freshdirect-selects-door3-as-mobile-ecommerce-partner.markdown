Original Release Date: July 12, 2010 — FreshDirect announced the selection of DOOR3 as their long-term mobile eCommerce strategy and delivery partner. “Mobile is a great opportunity to serve our customers more effectively. DOOR3’s expertise in eCommerce strategy, systems integration, and mobile technologies like iPhone, Android and Blackberry makes them an ideal partner,” said Dean Marano, FreshDirect’s Chief Information Officer.  “We’ve worked with DOOR3 successfully in the past and we look forward to working with them again on this exciting new program.”

“We’re very happy to work with FreshDirect again,” said Alex Asianov, DOOR3’s President of Enterprise Services. “It’s great to be able to share our expertise in mobile commerce with such a fantastic brand.  Mobile tools create new opportunities to meaningfully engage customers and generate sales. They are mission-critical customer touch-points requiring the same level of strategic planning, user experience design, and technical execution as any serious software-driven business initiative, and this plays to DOOR3’s strengths. “

“We see opportunities for our eCommerce customers to increase cart size, order frequency, and new customer acquisition through mobile solutions and brand extensions.” said Peter Neufeld, DOOR3 eCommerce specialist. “Our customers are seeing the real financial benefit of including mobile in their customer growth strategy.”

Over the next two years DOOR3 will provide a variety of strategy, design, and technology services to FreshDirect to extend and enhance the customer experience and increase sales across emerging mobile platforms.
